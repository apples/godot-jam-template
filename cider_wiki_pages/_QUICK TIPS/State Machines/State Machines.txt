The script editor has a new `Cider State` menu.

This menu can setup the state machine, add new states, and quickly navigate to a state.

The states are generated with all supported functions present, but none of these functions are required, and may be deleted.

The state setup introduces a `_cider_state` var, which holds the state machine itself, `CiderState`.

`CiderState` has only one interesting property:

`current_state: StringName`

This is the name of the current state. If it is `&""`, the state machine is disabled.

When set, it will perform the necessary `exit`/`enter` calls for the states involved.

[font s=24]goto[/font]

This is a helper method that sets `current_state`.

It doesn't do anything special, it's just easier to type.
