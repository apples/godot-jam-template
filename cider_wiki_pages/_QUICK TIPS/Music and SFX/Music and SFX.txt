[font s=24]Sound effects[/font]

To play a simple sound effect, use:

[[code:gd]]
MusicMan.sfx(preload("res://sfx/bloop.wav"))
[[/]]

By default, each sound effect has no polyphony, or in other words, the sound will restart if played again while it is currently playing.

To control polyphony, pass an [code]owner[/code] and [code]max_polyphony[/code] parameter:

[[code:gd]]
MusicMan.sfx(preload("res://sfx/bloop.wav"), null, 14)
[[/]]


[font s=24]Music[/font]

Always use [code]MusicMan[/code] to play music:

[[code:gd]]
MusicMan.music(preload("res://music/main_theme.ogg"))
[[/]]

This will ensure that the music isn't interrupted if it's already playing, and will apply a crossfade.
