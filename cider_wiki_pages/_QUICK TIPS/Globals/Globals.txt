[code]Globals[/code] is an autoload singleton that manages global game state.

If you have a value that needs to be accessed in many different unrelated places, this is where to add it.

[font s=24]Adding variables[/font]

To add a variable to [code]Globals[/code], create it as usual, but use a setter to emit the [code]changed[/code] signal.

[[code:gd]]
## Example variable.
var player_health: int = 0:
	set(v): player_health = v; changed.emit()
[[/]]

Additionally, add a line to the [code]reset()[/code] method to reset the variable:

[[code:gd]]
## Reset all variables to their default state.
func reset():
	player_health = 0
[[/]]

[font s=24]Using variables[/font]

Simply access the variable directly:

[[code:gd]]
Globals.player_health
[[/]]

You can also connect to the [code]changed[/code] signal if needed:

[[code:gd]]
func _ready() -> void:
	Globals.changed.connect(_on_globals_changed)

func _on_globals_changed() -> void:
	healthbar.value = Globals.player_health
[[/]]
